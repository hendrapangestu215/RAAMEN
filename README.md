# RAAMEN
RAAMEN is a web-based online ramen selling application. It is a great place for buyer to buy ramen and for seller to sell their shows. This project is made using the Visual Studio 2019 software, with the ASP.NET Web Application
framework, and C# programming language. We used Domain Driven Design method to developed RAAMEN website with layers, such as view, controller, handler, repository, factory, and model. Hopefully this RAAMEN web application 
can help for customers to order ramen easily wherever they are.
